# ChatBot
## Airport ChatBot

<!--Title-->
## Purpose
<!--Purpose of the project-->
The aim of this initiative is to create robots that can aid travelers during their airport waiting
time. These robots will possess cutting-edge sensors and scanners, such as facial recognition
technology, passport and barcode scanners, and a high-quality display for presenting up-to-date information. This project seeks to develop a model capable of forecasting passenger satisfaction using
various data points gathered through airport questionnaires. By taking into account factors
such as gender, age, ticket class, customer loyalty, and whether the trip is for business or
personal reasons, this model will aid in improving our robot’s performance to better cater to
passengers’ needs.

## Description

The following repository includes the code of the chatbot that will be used by our robot to communicate with airport passengers, it uses voice recognition models to interpret user responses. It also includes sample images of the execution as seen below, in addition to a presentation detailing all aspects of the project that we used in the 7th GCC Robotics Competition.
